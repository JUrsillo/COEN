//Complexity O(n)
LIST* createDataSet(int maxElts);

//Complexity O(n)
void destroyDataSet (LIST *lt);

//Complexity O(n)

void deletion (LIST* lt, int id);

I chose to use an array as my data structure because most of the complexities were either O(1) or O(n). I found that it was more efficient
than the other data structures and that it worked better for this assignment in particular. For insertion, it was more beneficial to use
an array since the data was unsorted and we could just add elements to the end of the array. Overall, an array data structure was most
efficient for this project because it did not require complex operations and it was not sorted which made using an array much more feasiable.
